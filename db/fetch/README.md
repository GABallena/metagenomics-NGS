# db/fetch

Acquisition helpers for reference datasets.

Notes:
- Outputs should go to a local working directory (e.g., `db/fetch/downloads/`) that is **gitignored**.
- Avoid committing any downloaded files.

Some scripts may interact with upstream resources that have usage terms (e.g., scraping). Use responsibly.
